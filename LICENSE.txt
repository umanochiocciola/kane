With the following additions:
  * Mention the original source (https://github.com/umanochiocciola/kane) in a visible main readme file
  * Keep it open source. We do this for the joy of it
  * If you want to create a "distro" of this, in order to call it a proper Kane distribution, you may use the same license and, following Kane's ethic, keep the product free.
