# Kane

Version: 2.0.9

Setup:
    To correctly setup Kane on windows I suggest to place the MainKane folder directly in the C: directory. This makes all easier ;)
    You can than create a shortcut to the terminal in the startup folder
    C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
    To get the full geek experience press fn+f11 to make the terminal window full screen
    On linux, I suggest to place MainKane in /home folder. 

CHANGELOG:
    Version 2.0.9.6.1  - internal security -
    Added protection to user's home folder. Only that user can access it
    Added user verification: you were able to switch user without verification with py user='TargetUserName', now Kane will check for discrepancies in usernames
    Improved 'lemme see' command: now it gives you a list of active variables in the program
    With 'lemme see all' it will also show functions(with memory adress) and modules
	

Sintax:
    Kane terminal supports either his own commands either your os ones.
    To get a list of useful commands type help.

What's Kane?
    Kane is a subOS. A subOS is an Operating Sistem that lives on another.

    Why having a subOS?
	since kane has just a terminal with no graphics, you might miss (is it possible?) the window based stuff.

Open Source Notes:
    This is a full open source. This means than you have free access to the project and its source code.
    If you paid for this pretend a refund!
