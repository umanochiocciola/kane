Version: 2.0.9

Setup:
	To correctly setup Kane on windows I suggest to place the MainKane folder directly in the C: directory. This makes all easier ;)
	You can than create a shortcut to the terminal in the startup folder
		C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

	To get the full geek experience press fn+f11 to make the terminal window full screen

	On linux, I suggest to place MainKane in /home folder. 

	
Sintax:
	Kane terminal supports either his own commands either your os ones.
	To get a list of useful commands type help.

What's Kane?
	Kane is a subOS. A subOS is an Operating Sistem that lives on another.

	Why having a subOS?
		Since kane has just a terminal with no graphics, you might miss (is it possible?) the window based stuff.
